  # Express.js Note Taker App - Challenge 11

  ## Description: 
  The goal of this project was to build an application that could be used to write and save notes. We were to use an Express.js back end and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. In the coming weeks, I intend to come back to this project to add the delete function.
